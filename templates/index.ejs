	<h1>Welcome to PokeFav</h1>
	<hr>
	Did you always want to "catch 'em' all" as a child but didn't have the money for the games?<br>
	Then you should be playing Pokemon GO. <br>
	But if that doesn't appeal to you, you can get your own 
	personal collection of pokemon right here.
	<hr>
	
	Search pokemon <a href="/search">Search</a><br>
	See all your favorite pokemon as a table <a href="/viewAll">View Table</a><br>
	Remove all favorite pokemon <a href="/removeApp">Remove all Pokemon</a><br>
